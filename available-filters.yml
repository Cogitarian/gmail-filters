# Every gmail filter has its own 13-character numerical id.
# In order to support a download-edit-reupload workflow,
# it's important that the same conceptual filters always use the same ids.
# Thus, we use the following scheme to construct an id
# <6-digit id_prefix> + <6-digit recipe id> + <index of filter within recipe>
#
# When the program receives a downloaded xml file,
# all filters starting with id_prefix
# are presumed to be managed by the program.
# Since I don't think gmail filter uplaod supports deleting filters,
# filters the program believes should be deleted on update
# will be written out as empty filters, i.e. filters that perform no action
# that way, they user can manually delete them if they wish.
#
# I just did a preliminary check, and it seems that there's...
# ...no way to even _replace_ a given filter through a gmail upload.
# Not sure if I'm missing some semantics here, since that seems really odd,
# and renders this whole id thing useless.
